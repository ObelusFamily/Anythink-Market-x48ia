## Getting Started

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (for local development)

2. Clone the repo (for local development)

3. Create your [own workspace codespace](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=548219800) (use the defaults)

4. Run `docker-compose up` in your codespace's terminal to load both the frontend and the backend

5. Test by pointing your browser to <https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-x48ia-55556j5wx5rf49rq-3000.githubpreview.dev/api/ping>

6. If everything works you should be able to create a new user on <https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-x48ia-55556j5wx5rf49rq-3001.githubpreview.dev/register>

## Development

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
